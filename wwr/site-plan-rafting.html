        <h2>River or Waterway</h2>
        <h3>Physical Activity and Exercise</h3>
        <p>Rafting requires physical effort and coordination, providing participants with a challenging and rewarding form of exercise.</p>
        <h3>School and Youth Groups</h3>
        <p>Encompassing anyone with an interest in outdoor adventure, recreation, and appreciation of nature.</p>
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <h3>Website Logo</h3>
        <img src="/wwr/images/rafinglogo.png" alt="Rafting Site Logo">
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>The water was icy cold, cold enough to make you tremble to the bone.  I don’t think water surrounding an iceberg in the arctic could have been any colder.  Each time I was splashed, thoughts of hypothermia flashed through my head.</p>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Example Font</h4>
        <h4>Normal Text/Paragraph Example Font</h4>
        <p>Our raft almost sank a few times because of the constant splashing of water into our raft.  Each time we passed a stretch of rapids, and especially when we made it to the top of each fall a sense of anticipation would come over me I didn’t know what would happen next. </p>
        <h4>Colored Callout Example Font</h4>
        <p>There was always a chance that our raft might hit a boulder and flip, or that someone might fall out.  We were always passing these jagged rocks and giant boulders that could have easily flipped our raft or got us stuck.  Some of the rocks were sharp enough to give you a bad gash or even break a bone if you hit them with enough force.</p>
